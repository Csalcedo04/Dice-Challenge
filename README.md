# Solution of Dice Challenge proposed by https://www.appbrewery.com.

This challenge was about to use all that knowledge that I learned about the DOM and Javascript to create a dice game, where everytime the page is reload, the dices change their number and the text of the `h1` change to say what dice win or if itÂ´s a draw . I decided to do the extramile and do all the program by the scratch, so I can improve my frontend skills.

## The target solution

## Proposed front-end improvements
I saw that the page wasn't so responsive, and after the screen reaches`688px`, the size of the text of the `h1` and the width of the dices, were way to big for the screen and take a lot of space of it, so I use the following code to fix that:

```css
@media (max-width:688px  ) { 
    h1{
        font-size: 6rem;
    }
    img{
        width:  50%;
    }
    .container{
    width: 100%;
   }

```
```css
/*phone screens*/
@media (max-width:532px  ) { 
    h1{
        margin: 10.5px;
    }
    img{
        width: 30%;
    }

}
```
### And this how it looks:
